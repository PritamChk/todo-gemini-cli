ðŸš€ Excited to share a project I've been building: **Gemini Notes**!

This is a full-stack todo application designed for efficient task management. It's built with FastAPI (Python) on the backend and a responsive frontend using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

Key features include:
âœ… Data Persistence (JSON file-based)
âœ… Interactive Checklists
âœ… Dynamic Sorting & Filtering (by date, title, timestamps)
âœ… Responsive and Colorful UI

What made this development journey particularly insightful was leveraging the **Gemini CLI** as an interactive development partner. This allowed for:
ðŸ’¡ **Rapid Prototyping:** Iteratively building features and seeing immediate results.
ðŸ’¡ **Efficient Debugging:** Pinpointing and resolving issues with direct assistance.
ðŸ’¡ **Streamlined Workflow:** Automating repetitive tasks and focusing on core logic.
ðŸ’¡ **Continuous Learning:** Exploring new implementations and best practices in real-time.

This project truly demonstrated the power of AI-assisted development in enhancing productivity and accelerating the learning curve.
